This is my university project for the subject "Technologies for WEB Publishing I". This project contains 5 static pages and images for them. Also, a CSS file is connected to these files and JavaScript is used for animations. This site is uploaded to the school server, you can see it <a href="https://lide.uhk.cz/fim/student/velikal1/" target="_blank">here</a>.
